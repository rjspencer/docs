# Home
Hello there! You are about to embark on an epic journey through StageBloc's Theming Engine documentation. It may sound scary, but you won't have any issues if you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript.

These docs aim to make using the Theming Engine super simple. Do note that if there is every something you'd like exposed in the Theming Engine that doesn't already appear to be available, feel free to contact us asking if we'd be able to add it for you.

### General Information
In general, a theme consists of defining the pages that make sense for your website and filling them with data. Each `{page}` represents a separate URL on the site. The data within each `{page}` is built using any combination of `{module}`s and `{block}`s.

It is easiest to think of `{module}`s as `for` loops that loop through various data from your StageBloc account. Within a `{module}` a `{block}` can be used to represent a "model" of the data by exposing various pieces of information about that data.

StageBloc also then has various `{if}` statements and other helpful variables to make themes as customizable as possible.

The general structure of a theme is simply repeating chunks of code with the following structure. HTML can be placed anywhere inside of this hierarchy:

	{page:PageName}
		{module:ModuleName}
			{block:BlockName}
			{/block:BlockName}
		{/module:ModuleName}
	{/page:PageName}

Some useful notes...

* If you don't explicitly provide a favicon in the `<head>` of your HTML, we'll add the [default StageBloc favicon](https://stagebloc.com/favicon.ico) for you. To add your own favicon, simply upload it as a Theme Asset and put it in your theme's `<head>` HTML tag.

* We add various `<meta>` tags to your `<head>` content if they aren't explicitly set to aid in SEO. For instance, many tags from the [Open Graph Protocol](http://ogp.me/) are automatically added.

* We allow you to upload assets *(images, fonts, favicons, etc)* to our CDN and encourage you to use this when creating a theme. This means you don't have to host any part of your theme outside of StageBloc, making it easier for you.

* CSS and JS are both minified before being uploaded to our CDN so that you get the maximum performance and caching when users come to your site. Sometimes errors can occur during this process. If you notice your JS or CSS behaving differently once uploaded, please let us know.

Some tips...

* Use semicolons in JavaScript. As mentioned above, do compress / minify your JavaScript before we upload it to our CDN so this will help ensure less issues occur.

* Remember to keep metadata in mind. For instance, when people share links to Facebook, you have control over the information Facebook pulls from the page. Check out this [obligatory StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7623986/115629) for more info.

## Local Theme Dev
StageBloc themes can be edited in a web based sidebar, but that isn't ideal when doing rapid development and prototyping of a theme. For that reason, we've built an open source, PHP based tool to allow for easy localhost theme development. The tool simply uses our API to render a theme and return the HTML back to you. As such, a similar tool could be built in any other language pretty easily.

For the PHP version, head over to our [Local Theme Dev](https://github.com/stagebloc/local-theme-dev) repo on GitHub. Once installed and running, it allows developers to quickly and easily swap between different themes and accounts to get a feel for how various data looks in their theme.

Please feel free to open issues and/or submit pull requests if you find ways to make it more useful.

## Submitting Themes
Once you've built your theme, you can submit it to the StageBloc team for approval to be sold in our marketplace. This can be done via the StageBloc backend for your account. Themes can be priced as whatever amount you see fit (as well as free), and the same percentages apply to themes that apply to any other products sold on StageBloc. Once someone purchases your theme, they'll get the full source code and will be able to install and use it on their account.

# Syntax
The StageBloc Theming Engine makes use of curly brackets and a few main building blocks for the majority of its syntax. The build blocks (page, modules, and blocks) should be kept lowercase as they are in these docs.

To find out more information about each building block, navigate to them in the navigation on the left hand side of this page.
	
## Pages
Each view (i.e. URL) on StageBloc in contained within a `{page}`. There are a bunch of built in pages, but [you can also create your own custom pages](#custom-pages). Any HTML, `{module}`s, or `{block}`s can be put inside of a `{page}`.

It is not necessary to define a view for every `{page}` available via the Theming Engine. Define pages that make sense for your theme, and the rest will be taken care of via a fallback theme we've created so that no links will be broken.

A page in its simplest form would look like the following block of code:

	{page:PageName}
		...
		HTML content, etc here
		...
	{/page:PageName}
	
### Custom Pages
Custom pages allow you to create pages at URLs that aren't already built into the Theming Engine. They can be defined using the following syntax:

	{page:CustomMyAwesomePage}
		...
		HTML content, etc here
		...
	{/page:CustomMyAwesomePage}

The URL for a custom page is simply whatever follows "Custom" in the page's definition (the above examples URL would be `/MyAwesomePage`). Using slashes within the page's definition is also allowable and allows easy creation of hierarchical URLs.

Any content that can be put inside of a built in page can be put inside of a custom page.
	
### Page Options
Pages can have options applied to them. Options are listed within the `{page}` code itself like below:

	{page:PageName optionName="optionValue"}
		...
		HTML content, modules, etc here
		...
	{/page:PageName}

The following options are available for `{page}`s:

`homepage`

	a flag representing if the page should be used as the homepage

	accepted values are true or false

	the default homepage is ActivityStreamList *if that page isn't defined the first defined Page in the theme's HTML will be used*

`url`

	a URL to override the page's default URL

	accepted values are any string valid in a URL, the [%id] is always assumed to be at the end *(Note: do not start the override URL with a slash (/))*

		{page:EventList url="shows"}
			<!-- The events page would now be at /shows, not /events -->
		{/page:EventList}

	default value is based on the page or whatever comes after "Custom" for custom pages

	if a page has more than one [%id] (i.e. `BlogCommentView`), use an asterik (*) for the first [%id]

`title`

	a value to force the <title> of the <head> content of the page to be

	accepts any string

    default value will be based on the `{module}`s present on the rendered page

`ajax`

	a GET parameter value that can be used to output ONLY the stuff within a specific page (i.e. strip out any headers, footers, etc) *note: this is useful for infinite scrolling with AJAX*

	accepted values are true and false

	default value is false
	
`searchable`

	whether or not this page should be able to be indexed by search engines
	
	accepted values are true and false
	
	defaults to true
	
## Modules
Modules are the main data loading structures within `{page}`s. The general syntax for modules is as follows:

	{module:ModuleName}
		...
		HTML content, blocks, etc here
		...
	{Else:ModuleName}
		...
		Data to show if the module doesn't return any
		...
	{/module:ModuleName}

Modules come in two types, views and lists. A listing module will iterate through numerous pieces of content and repeat the content within the module as many times as it finds pieces of data.

Using `{Else:<module_name>}` will cause the content in the else section to render if the module doesn't load any data.

### Module Options
Modules can have their own options. Some of the options are available to all `{module}`s while other are specific to particular `{module}`s. The syntax for module options is the exact same as that of `{page}`s and looks as follows:

	{module:ModuleName optionName="optionValue"}
		...
		HTML content, blocks, etc here
		...
	{/module:ModuleName}
	
The following options are an example of two options that are available on most listing modules. All of the available options for a particular `{module}` can be found by the documentation for that specific modules elsewhere in these docs.

`pagination`

	flag representing if the module should be used as the primary module for pagination on the parent {page}

	accepted values are true or false

	defaults to what the Theming Engine decides is best

`ignorePaging`

	available on most listing modules to make the module ignore any pagination that might be preset in the header

	accepted values are true or false

	defaults to false
	
### Module If Statements
**if:PositionInModule**  
Checks to see what block is currently being rendered in the listing module. The first item in the module is `1` (i.e. it is 1 indexed)

`gt`

	check if the position is greater than a certain point
	
	accepted values are any integer
	
	defaults to none

`lt`

	check if the position is less than a certain point

	accepted values are any integer

	defaults to none

`e`

	check to see if the position is equal to a certain point

	accepted values are any integer

	defaults to none

`multipleOf`

	check to see if the position is a multiple of a number

	accepted values are any integer

	defaults to none

## Blocks
Blocks can best be thought of us the models of the data and must be inside of a `{module}`. When inside of a listing `{module}`, a `{block}` will be repeated as many times as necessary depending on the returned data. The general syntax for `{block}`s is as follows:

	{block:BlockName}
		...
		HTML content, block variables, etc here
		...
	{/block:BlockName}
	
Depending on the block you are using, different data variables become available that allow you to represent the object on the page.

## Variables
Variables are the simplest of Theming Engine elements and return the finest level of detail about an object. Using a variable simply looks like the follow:
	
	{VariableName}
	
Using options with a variable is just like using options with any other Theming Engine elements:
	
	{VariableWithOption optionOneName="optionOneValue" optionTwoName="optionTwoValue"}
	
All variables have the `block` option available to them to force them to render within the context of a certain `{block}`. This usually isn't necessary unless you have two nested `{block}`s and want to make sure the variables renders at the correct time.

### Custom Variables
You can use custom variables to define chunks of code to reuse throughout the rest of your theme. This can be useful when repeating layout elements on your site on some pages, but not others.

To define a variable, use the following syntax:

	{variable:CustomMyVariable}
		...
		Any content here
		...
	{/variable:CustomMyVariable}

Custom variables must start with "Custom" in their names. In this example, your variable name would be `MyVariable`. After defining your variable, you can access it just like a normal variable. For instance, to use the above variable we just defined, you'd write the following anywhere in your theme:

	{CustomMyVariable}

### {option} Variables
You can set up ways for StageBloc users to customize their theme to their liking without them doing any HTML/CSS/JS editing by using `{option}` variables. Options variables are pulled into the sidebar theme editor on the web and presented using `<form>` elements that less technical users can use to customize their theme. The general syntax for an `{option}` variable is:

	{option:VariableType
		group="VariableGroup"
		name="Variable Name"
		default="Default Value"
		format=""
		defaultFormat=""}

Keep in mind that less is often more. If someone wants very specific, fine tune control, it's best if they just edit the theme.

The following parameters are available to all `{option}` variables:

`name` (*required*)

	The unique name for this variable. This name is also presented to the user in the sidebar theme editor.

`group`

	A namespace for this variable. This is used to group variables in the sidebar theme editor.

`format`

	The way the data is outputted. This makes use of PHP's [sprintf()](http://php.net/sprintf) function if you'd like to force a format.

`defaultFormat`

	The default format to be used for the data.

`default`

	When the user doesn't explicitly set or change this option, this value will be used.

The following `{option}` variables are currently available for use:

**option:Image**

This `{option}` variable allows users to upload an image to use within their theme (i.e. a header image). This shouldn't be used for things like sprites or other theme assets. A file upload box will show up in the theme editor sidebar where they can upload JPEG, GIF, and PNG files to be used in the theme. The data returned is the full URL to the image uploaded.

	{option:Image
		group="Images"
		name="Header Image"
		format="background-image: url(%s);"
		defaultFormat=""}

**option:Color**

This `{option}` variable will present users with a color select box in the theme sidebar. The user can then select a color to use (i.e. font color). The additional parameter of `rgb` is available for this option. The data returned will be the full HEX value with the pound sign or the colors, comma separated (see `rgb` parameter below).

`rgb`

	Determines whether or not to return RGB or HEX values
	
	accepted values are true or false
	
	defaults to false

An example:

	{option:Color
		group="Colors"
		name="Footer Color"
		format="color: rgb(%s);"
		defaultFormat=""}

**option:Select**

This `{option}` variable adds a drop down box containing a list of predefined values to the sidebar. The data returned is the value selected.

`presets`
	Defines a comma separated list of values

An example:

	{option:Select
		group="Images"
		name="Background Repeat"
		format="background-repeat: %s;"
		presets="repeat,no-repeat,repeat-x,repeat-y"
		default="no-repeat"
	}

**option:Textarea**

This `{option}` variable presents users with a textbox where they can input any string. The data returned is the user's string.

## If Statements
If statements will check if a certain statement is true or not and add the appropriate code as defined within the theme. Else statements can be achieved by placing `{if:Else}` inside of an if statement. For example, an if statement in its simplest form could be as follows:

	{if:IfStatementName}
		...
		This content will be used if the statement is true
		...
	{if:Else}
		...
		This content will be used if the statement is false
		...
	{/if:IfStatementName}

If statements can be nested inside of one another as well.

### If Statement Options
Various if statements have different options available to them depending on the statement. The syntax is exactly the same as `{pags}`s and `{module}`s:

	{if:IfStatementName optionName="optionValue"}
		...
		This content will be used if the statement is true
		...
	{/if:IfStatementName}
	
An option that is available to all if statements is `block`. Sometimes for if statements that can be used in numerous different `{block}`s where weird behavior is happening because of the nested, you can use the `block` option to have finer control over when the if statement is rendered.

`block`

	the {block} to force the if statement to render as a part of

	accepted values any parent {block} of the if statement

	defaults to the theming engines best guess

### Combined If Statements
If statements support the use of `||` and `&&` for AND and OR logic. However, mixing of ANDs and ORs is not currently allowed (i.e. it must be all ANDs or all ORs). For example:

	{if:IfStatementOne||IfStatementTwo}
		...
		This content will be used if either of the if statements are true
		...
	{/if:IfStatementOne||IfStatementTwo}
	
# Sections
The main sections of the Theming Engine line up with the available content you can create and share on StageBloc.

In general, the documentation for each section goes from higher level to lower level. It will first list the pages. After the pages, the modules are listed with their available options. The block is listed after the modules and can be used inside of any of the modules for that section. After the definition of the block, all of the variables (and variables with options) available to that block specifically are listed.

Lastly, the if statements are listed for that block as well. Unless otherwise noted, if statements must be used inside of the corresponding block *(some are global and can be used anywhere)*.

# SBNav
SBNav is the little, circular control box that appears in a corner of the screen. It allows users to, among other things, log in, follow and unfollow accounts, and manage their shopping cart. It is also the means of communication by which our [Advanced Functionality](#advanced-functionality) is achieved.

As a theme author, you can change a few things about it. If an account has white labeling enabled, SBNav may be removed from their account.

### {SBNav position=""}
You can set the position of SBNav with the `{SBNav}` variable. Place it anywhere in your theme and SBNav will be placed in the specified corner.

`position`

	The corner to place SBNav in

    Accepted values are two words in any order, separated by a space: top, bottom, left, right

	Default value is "bottom right"

### SBNav Color
When submitting a theme, you can select a default color that you feel best matches your theme. Just as a head up, users do have the option to override this in their account's theme management section.

# Advanced Functionality
Using JavaScript and [SBNav](#sbnav) we are able to expose some advanced functionality. The functionality allowed here is available using built in StageBloc modals, but these methods allow theme authors to have a little bit more control over how it looks and works in their theme. In general, advanced functionality is achieved by targeting SBNav via `postMessage` as follows:

	pm({ target: window.frames['sbnav'], type: 'advancedFunctionalityType', data: { key: value } });

The postMessage JS library is already included for you. The `target` parameter must be exactly as shown above.

When a request such as the above is made, SBNav will act accordingly given the data provided and callback one of the following two bindings:

	pm.bind('advancedFunctionalityType', function(data) {
		// data will be a JavaScript object representing the state of the request
		// If data.error is defined, an error occurred during the request
	});

	pm.bind('sbError', function(data) {
		// This binding will handle generic errors (i.e. if SBNav receives a 500 or anything for any reason)
		// data.type will be the action it came from (i.e. 'advancedFunctionalityType')
	});

## User Profile Editing
This allows the user's profile to be edited.

**Step One**

First, you'll need some sort way of having users add information. For instance, you could do:

 	{module:API v="3.0" path="user/list" me="true"}
 		{block:API}
		<form id="userEditForm">
			<input type="hidden" name="email" value="{email}" />
			<input type="hidden" name="username" value="{username}" />
			<textarea name="bio">{bio}</textarea>
			<input type="submit" value="Save Profile" />
		</form>
		{/block:API}
	{/module:API}

The available keys for passing are `name`, `username`, `email`, `bio`, and `gender`. You can also pass a `birthday` parameter as an array with the keys `day`, `month`, and `year`.

You are also able to pass a user photo with the `photoFile` key, but it requires that the browser support `FileReader`. When a `file` input is changed, you can show a preview of the image on the page using code similar to the following:

	if (typeof FileReader === 'undefined') {
	  alert('Sorry, but your browser is too old to upload photos. Please upgrade!');
	  return;
	}

	var reader = new FileReader();
	reader.onload = function(event) {
	  _userPhotoData = event.target.result; // A global variable for holding this image
	  $('#userPhotoPreview').css('background-image', 'url(' + newPhotoData + ')');
	};
	reader.readAsDataURL(this.files[0]);

**Step Two**

Next, when the user submits the form, you'll want to capture it with JavaScript similar to the following:

	$('#userEditForm').submit(function() {
		var formData = $(this).serialize() + '&photoFile=' + _userPhotoData;
		pm({ target: window.frames['sbnav'], type: 'sbInlineUserProfileEdit', data: formData });
		return false;
	});

**Step Three**

Finally, you should add a binding to your theme's JavaScript. You can use this callback to handle the data returned from SBNav.

	pm.bind('sbInlineUserProfileEdit', function(data) {
		// data will be a JavaScript object representing the user (or an error if an error occurred)
	});

## Commenting
Normally, adding comments can be done very easily with the use of the `{CommentLink}` variable that opens an SBNav modal. However, sometimes you'll want to have commenting inline within your page to give the user a different experience.

**Step One**

First, need some sort of `HTML` to get the necessary data. Here's an example:

	<form id="commentForm">
		<input type="hidden" name="content_slug" value="{ContentType-Photos}" />
		<input type="hidden" name="content_id" value="{PhotoId}" />
		<textarea name="commentText"></textarea>
		<input type="submit" value="Post Comment" />
	</form>
	
Note that `content_id` and `content_slug` will vary depending on the content you're trying to comment on and will most likely be received from some sort of `{block}` data within your theme.

There is also an optional `replyToId` parameter that can be passed to serve as the `id` of the original comment if this new comment is meant to be a reply to it.

**Step Two**

Next, when the user submits the form, you'll want to capture it with JavaScript similar to the following:

	$('#commentForm').submit(function() {
		pm({ target: window.frames['sbnav'], type: 'sbInlineComment', data: $(this).serialize() });
		return false;
	});
	
The passed data must contain the keys `content_slug`, `content_id`, and `commentText` with their respective values for it to be valid.

**Step Three**

Finally, you should add a binding to your theme's JavaScript. You can use this callback to handle the data returned from SBNav.

	pm.bind('sbInlineComment', function(data) {
		// data will be a JavaScript representing the comment that was posted (or an error if an error occurred)
	});

## Comment Loading
Normally, viewing comments can be done very easily with the use of the `{CommentLink}` variable that opens an SBNav modal. However, sometimes you'll want to have comments inline within your page to give the user a different experience. Initial comments can be loaded with `{module:CommentList}`, but you'll want to be careful not to load every single comment on the initial page load. This advanced functionality can be used to allow for loading more comments after the initial page load.

**Step One**

You'll want to make a call to the `sbInlineLoadComments` functionality of SBNav:

	pm({ target: window.frames['sbnav'],
		 type: 'sbInlineLoadComments',
		 data: { contentType: $(this).attr('data-content-type'), // i.e. {ContentType-Photos}
				 contentId: $(this).attr('data-content-id'),
				 limit: 20, // Any number
				 offset: 10 // Any number, probably based on the amount of comments already loaded
		 }
	});

The passed data must contain the keys `contentType` and `contentId` to be valid.

**Step Two**

Finally, you should add a binding to your theme's JavaScript. You can use this callback to handle the data returned from SBNav.

	pm.bind('sbInlineLoadComments', function(data) {
		// data will be a JavaScript array representing the additional comments (or an error if an error occurred)
	});
	
## Status Submission
Normally, adding statuses can be done very easily with the use of `{SubmitFanContentLink}` variable that opens an SBNav modal. However, sometimes you'll want to allow fans to submit statuses for your fansite from within the theme itself.

**Step One**

First, you'll need some sort of `HTML` form. Here's an example:

	<form id="statusSubmit">
		<input type="text" name="statusText" />
		<input type="submit" />
	</form>

**Step Two**

Next, when the user submits the form, you'll want to capture it with JavaScript similar to the following:

	$('#statusSubmit').submit(function() {
		pm({ target: window.frames['sbnav'], type: 'sbInlineSubmitStatus', data: $(this).serialize() });
		return false;
	});
	
The passed data must contain the key `statusText` for it to be valid.

**Step Three**

Finally, you should add a binding to your theme's JavaScript. You can use this callback to handle the data returned from SBNav.

	pm.bind('sbInlineSubmitStatus', function(data) {
		// data will be a JavaScript object representing the status that was posted (or an error if an error occurred)
	});

## Photo Submission
Normally, adding photo can be done very easily with the use of `{SubmitFanContentLink}` variable that opens an SBNav modal. However, sometimes you'll want to allow fans to submit photos for your fansite from within the theme itself. Note that this method does require that the user's browser supports `FileReader`.

**Step One**

First, you'll need some sort of `HTML` form. Here's an example:

	<form id="photoSubmit">
		<input type="file" name="photoFile" id="photoFile" />
		<input type="submit" />
	</form>
	
When this `file` input changes, you'll want to put the data for that image somewhere on the page where you can get it later or store it in a global variable. Below is an example of how to do that as well as how to show the user a preview of the image:

	$('body').on('change', '#photoFile', function() {
		if (typeof FileReader === 'undefined') {
		  alert('Sorry, but your browser is too old to upload photos. Please upgrade!');
		  return;
		}

		var reader = new FileReader();
		reader.onload = function(event) {
	        var img = new Image();
	        img.src = event.target.result;
	        $('#photoPreview').html(img);
			$('#userPhotoPreview').css('background-image', 'url(' + newPhotoData + ')');
		};
		reader.readAsDataURL(this.files[0]);
	}

**Step Two**

Next, when the user submits the form, you'll want to capture it with JavaScript similar to the following:

	$('#photoSubmit').submit(function() {
		var formData = $(this).serialize() + '&photoFile=' + $('#photoPreview img').attr('src');
		pm({ target: window.frames['sbnav'], type: 'sbInlineSubmitPhoto', data: formData });
		return false;
	});

The passed data must contain the key `statusText` for it to be valid.

**Step Three**

Finally, you should add a binding to your theme's JavaScript. You can use this callback to handle the data returned from SBNav.

	pm.bind('sbInlineSubmitPhoto', function(data) {
		// data will be a JavaScript object representing the photo that was posted (or an error if an error occurred)
	});

## Blog Submission
Normally, adding blogs can be done very easily with the use of `{SubmitFanContentLink}` variable that opens an SBNav modal. However, sometimes you'll want to allow fans to submit blogs for your fansite from within the theme itself.

**Step One**

First, you'll need some sort of `HTML` form. Here's an example:

	<form id="blogSubmit">
		<input type="text" name="blogTitle" />
		<textarea name="blogBody"></textarea>
		<input type="submit" />
	</form>

**Step Two**

Next, when the user submits the form, you'll want to capture it with JavaScript similar to the following:

	$('#blogSubmit').submit(function() {
		pm({ target: window.frames['sbnav'], type: 'sbInlineSubmitBlog', data: $(this).serialize() });
		return false;
	});
	
The passed data must contain the keys `blogTitle` and `blogBody` for it to be valid. You can also pass a comma separated list of words to use as tags with the key `blogTags`.

**Step Three**

Finally, you should add a binding to your theme's JavaScript. You can use this callback to handle the data returned from SBNav.

	pm.bind('sbInlineSubmitBlog', function(data) {
		// data will be a JavaScript object representing the blog that was posted (or an error if an error occurred)
	});

## Video Submission
Normally, adding videos can be done very easily with the use of `{SubmitFanContentLink}` variable that opens an SBNav modal. However, sometimes you'll want to allow fans to submit videos for your fansite from within the theme itself.

**Step One**

First, you'll need some sort of `HTML` form. Here's an example:

	<form id="videoSubmit">
		<input type="text" name="videoRawUrl" />
		<input type="submit" />
	</form>

**Step Two**

Next, when the user submits the form, you'll want to capture it with JavaScript similar to the following:

	$('#videoSubmit').submit(function() {
		pm({ target: window.frames['sbnav'], type: 'sbInlineSubmitVideo', data: $(this).serialize() });
		return false;
	});
	
The passed data must contain the key `videoRawUrl` for it to be valid (we'll then use oEmbed to grab the data for the video). You can explicitly pass `videoTitle` if you'd like. You can also pass a comma separated list of words to use as tags with the key `videoTags`.

**Step Three**

Finally, you should add a binding to your theme's JavaScript. You can use this callback to handle the data returned from SBNav.

	pm.bind('sbInlineSubmitVideo', function(data) {
		// data will be a JavaScript object representing the video that was posted (or an error if an error occurred)
	});

## Email Subscriptions
When users are part of a fansite, they can manage their email subscriptions to that fansite in the backend. This is a way to add that functionality inline to your site.

**Step One**

First, you'll need some sort of `HTML` form. Here's an example:

	{module:API v="3.0" path="user/email_lists/list" account_id="{AccountId}"}
		{block:API}
			<form id="emailSubscriptionEdit">
				<input type="radio" name="subscribedStatus[{id}]" value="1" {if:APIKeyHasValue key="user_is_subscribed" value="true"}checked{/if:APIKeyHasValue} />Subscribe
				<input type="radio" name="subscribedStatus[{id}]" value="0" {if:APIKeyHasValue key="user_is_subscribed" value="false"}checked{/if:APIKeyHasValue} />Unsubscribe
			</form>
			{title}
		{/block:API}
	{/module:API}

**Step Two**

Next, when the user updates their preference, you'll want to capture it with JavaScript similar to the following:

	$('#emailSubscriptionEdit :input').change(function() {
		pm({ target: window.frames['sbnav'], type: 'sbInlineEmailSubscriptionEdit', data: $(this).parents('form').serialize() });
	});
	
The passed data must contain the array `subscribedStatus` with ID indices for it to be valid.

**Step Three**

Finally, you should add a binding to your theme's JavaScript. You can use this callback to handle the data returned from SBNav.

	pm.bind('sbInlineEmailSubscriptionEdit', function(data) {
		// data will be a JavaScript object representing the status that was posted (or an error if an error occurred)
	});
